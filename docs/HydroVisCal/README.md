# HydroVisCal

?> `HydroVisCal` (**Hydro**logy **Vis**ualization & **Cal**culation) is a `Python` package maintained by me. 

In scientific research, especially when it comes to computing and visualisation, we often need to write special code for our scientific tasks. Therefore, I have written some of the frequently used functional code in a more general form. In the future, this code will increase the efficiency of my work several times over.

# Generic Modules

- **Hydro_Generate**:  Used to generate some test data from scratch
- **Hydro_Plot**: Used for visualisation, e.g. box plots, trend plots  of multiple subplots, etc.
- **Hydro_MapPlot**: Used for mapping, including multiple submaps of maps and processing shp files
- **Hydro_Time**: Used to process time series data
- **Hydro_Format**: Used for conversion and export of various formats such as `nc`, `tif`, etc.
- **Hydro_MultiProcess**: Some Python multi-processing, multi-thread functions
- **Hydro_AI**: Some machine learning and deep learning related functions
